## Brief Key Architectural Drivers
> ### The Why

For figuring out what we needed for our architecture, we first needed to know how this game was going to be played, accessed and used. With this in mind, our game is a singleplayer game with no real need to access any outside information other than your saves and the game data. This would allow us to use a more secluded architecture that could be downloaded and work independently from any other systems.

We would need the game to be able to respond to updates in the system. This includes entering new areas, inventory systems, saved data, NPC interaction, and the combat system. Our code is currently based on classes. This means that every  component is coded separately but they are also able to easily interact with each other. An example of this is our collidable class and NPCs/Player classes. These classes are able to interact to centralize reusable code.
